In a country like India, where millions rely on the railway network for daily transportation, ensuring track safety is crucial. The Railway Track Obstacle Detection System is designed to address this need by identifying small obstacles on railway tracks using image processing and machine learning. The system monitors tracks in real time, detects potential hazards, and alerts authorities for quick action, helping to reduce accidents and minimize delays. This application is a vital step toward enhancing the safety and efficiency of India's extensive railway infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas.
